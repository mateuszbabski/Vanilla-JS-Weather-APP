# Weather APP

My second project done in Javascript. I focused on working with simple API - fetching, setting and showing data.

As before I didnt play too much with responsivness but more on functionality:

- showing current date
- showing current weather icon and temperature
- showing few more details about current atmosphere
- simple showing forecast weather
- changing background depending on current weather in city we declare
